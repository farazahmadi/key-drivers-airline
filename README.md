# key-drivers-airline

In this project I work on a survey data conducted by an airline company. The goal is to first prepare the data for analysis, and then predict their chance to return to the airline by their answeres to the survey, and finally identify the key drivers of customer's return.

The report is in [assign2.html](assign2.html).
